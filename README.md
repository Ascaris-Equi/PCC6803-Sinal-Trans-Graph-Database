Graph Database of Local Gene Networks for Depression（MDLGND）is a Integrative graph database including Genes and Pathways about Depression and their relationship.
At present, we only provide part of the content for demonstration. If you want to try, please refer to the following three ways for interactive access:

The GDLGND GraphNavigator not only helps you see the core and main parts of the dataset, but also provides an overview of the graph dataset.

The GDLGND NodeExplorer helps you find the desired node and the subnet composed of nodes that have a certain relationship with it.

The GDLGND RelationshipFinder is used to find the relationship between two nodes and intermediate nodes to build a subnet.
